# evklid-project
Creating progect with <a href = 'https://www.figma.com/file/ZckZUKF31dkAYWQQWufZtq/%D0%95%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B4-(new)?node-id=406480%3A4006&mode=dev'>Figma template</a>  
I used html for layout and css for styles  
No frameworks were used in this project, everything was built using flexboxes  
This site is adaptive for devices with resolution from 320 to 4k  
I have implemented cross browser compatibility for the following browsers: 
* Opera
* Yandex
* Chrome
* Edge (Chromium)
* Mozila Firefox
* Safari
* Samsung Internet

Also I made simply animation for links and buttons withous frameworks too  
And <a href = 'https://evklidkk.netlify.app/'> ___how it looks like___ </a>
